# Pydicom Tutorial

A short tutorial demonstrating usage of `pydicom`, a Python package for reading Dicom images.

Some example Dicom images are read in, the image pixel arrays are stored as numpy arrays, and the header information is printed.

A PDF file is available for quick reference, or the original Jupyter notebook can be directly used instead.
